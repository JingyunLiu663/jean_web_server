# Synchronous/Asynchronous Logging System

The synchronous/asynchronous logging system primarily involves two modules: a logging module and a blocking queue module. The inclusion of the blocking queue module is mainly to prepare for asynchronous log writing.
- Custom blocking queue
- Singleton pattern for creating logs
- Synchronous logging
- Asynchronous logging
- Implement log categorization by day and beyond a certain number of lines
